# Hi, I'm Saskia!

For this project, I wanted to create an introductory website that highlighted who I am as a college student as well as who I am as an aspiring UI/UX designer. Using a combination of images and short paragraphs, I tell the story of my field of study, my skills, my ideas for a potential project, and future plans. As the first project, this website helped me refresh myself with the practices and format of HTML and CSS.
